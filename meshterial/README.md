==========
This is a vulkan based 2d and 3d rendering system that supports some meshes.
Specifically those that use simple phong shading. The most convenient way to
render a model is to load a collada object file and feed it to a phong rendering
pipeline as described in the [example](example/src/main.rs).

WARNING
-------
This is a pre-alpha work in progress. I'm using it as a test bed and a dumping
ground for my personal rendering needs, YMMV. That said PRs, questions and
critiques are much, much appreciated!

Happy hacking!
